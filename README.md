# Kaltura Angular Packages

A set of packages, representing common infrastructure for angular based applications.

## Packages
Kaltura-ng is a monorepo containing several packages. Below you will find a summary of each package.

| Package | Version  |
|:--------|:-------|
| kaltura-client | ![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@kaltura-ng/kaltura-client.svg?maxAge=86400) |
| kaltura-common | ![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@kaltura-ng/kaltura-common.svg?maxAge=86400) |
| kaltura-ui | ![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@kaltura-ng/kaltura-ui.svg?maxAge=86400) |
| kaltura-primeng-ui | ![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@kaltura-ng/kaltura-primeng-ui.svg?maxAge=86400) |

> Those packages are being developed along side the [KMC-ng](https://github.com/kaltura/kmc-ng) application. 
  
## Technology stack
Kaltura Angular libraries use the following technologies:
* Best practices in file and application organization for [Angular 2]({https://angular.io/).
* [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) language (superset of Javascript).
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) as our dependency management.
* Stylesheets with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (not required, it supports regular css too).
* Error reported with [TSLint](http://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer).
* [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) - a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- [x]  Ensure that you have [node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/), version 7.0.0 or above. 
- [x] Ensure that you have [git installed](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) 
- [x] Ensure that you have [yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) (we use it for node package management) 

### Get the sources
Clone the repository and load project dependencies
```bash
# clone our repo
$ git clone https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-ng.git 

# change directory to your app
$ cd kaltura-ng

# install the dependencies with npm
$ yarn
```


### Setup your repo for local development
As this monorepo holds independent packages that depends on each other, you will need to symlink between them to be able to develop locally.


You need to run the following command to link everything together
```
$ yarn run setup
```

this command will run 'lerna' behind the scene to fetch node_modules for each package and if needed to create a symlink to dependent packages in this repo.

> To allow this structure and manage complex (dev)op operations without to much hassle we are using '[lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)' which is great tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories.


# FAQ

#### When I update any package dependency using `yarn add|upgrade`, the symlink between dependent packages are being removed. Why does it happen and how to overcome it?
There is a known issue with `yarn` (github issue [#1213](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1214)) that once you run `yarn` it will overwrite linked modules. 

Until this issue will be resolved by `yarn` team, to re-bootstrap everything together fast without re-fetching node_modules for each package use the following command:
```bash
$ yarn run setup:lite
```
